title: "Obsidian the Personal Knowledge Mangement tool"
---
I have become aware of Obsidian during early pandemic time. 
When I use it, it becomes clear that my search for PKM is over.
I have tried so many and everytime I have always stumble upon on challenges.

Some notes on them
> [!tldr]- Media Wiki
> 
> 👍🏽  Robust features. THE engine for [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/)
> 
> 👎🏽 Too complex for personal use: need database and server

> [!tldr] Evernote
> 
> 👍🏽  One of the early that catches my attention on note making
> 
> 👎🏽 Clunky. Proprietary. Generally not usable for my case

> [!tldr] Onenote
> 
> 👍🏽  It's one of the few cases that I like a Microsoft Product 😁 . There's also ipad interface that I like. It's usable even for complex notes as the search feature and the use of folder - note structure is pretty nice for organization.
